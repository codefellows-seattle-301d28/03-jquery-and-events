# Project Name

**Author**: Melanie Downing and Daniel Logerstedt
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Overview
This application is a blog site that allows a user to filter content by author or topic/category. It will also only show a preview of the article until the user clicks on the read on button. In the navigation bar, the home link will show articles and the about link will display the about-me section.

## Getting Started
This app only exists on local files, so the user must download the files of the project onto their own computer and open in live server in order to get it running.

## Architecture
This app uses JQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Change Log
11-30-2017 11:45am - Application now can be filtered but author or category. Articles are displayed as teasers until the read on button is clicked.
