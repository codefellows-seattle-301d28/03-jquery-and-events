# jQuery Events

**Author**: George & Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We were tasked with adding functioning filters that would allow a user to filter content by author or category, as well as hiding the bulk of the articles to allow a user to easily preview said articles without having to navigate through a wall of text. To make site navigation easier for users, we also needed to include tabular navigation on the header of the site.

As developers we needed to link in new JavaScript files to our index.html, refactor content as needed for cleanliness, and ensure that the page rendered properly on load as well as when interacting with the navigation tabs or the filters.

## Getting Started
To get this working properly, anyone seeking to do so would need to clone this repository, open it in their favorite editor, and open in their favorite browser. To modify content, such as articles, they would need to navigate to blogArticles.js and edit that content directly. Otherwise as a shell, it works just fine.

## Architecture
The languages used in the application were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The application was designed beginning from starter code and then building the functionality out of what was given. This included multiple JavaScript files to separate different layers of functionality as needed, and was the focus of our work. There were no necessary changes to CSS styling, and very minor changes necessary to the HTML file included (just linking in the new scripts). OUr focus was on articleView.js, and we build the aforementioned functionality layers (see overiew) from the starter code base.

We utilized the jQeury library in building this application.
