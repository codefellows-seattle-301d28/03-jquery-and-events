# Project Name

**Author**: Karen Perez and Hector Norza
**Version**: 1.2.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We decided to build this app in order to make it easier to navigate our ever growing blog. Using templates to publish new content and adding a filter has made our blog easier to mantain and grow!

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We have used JS, CSS and HTML and started using JQuery in order to build it and manipulate the DOM.

## Change Log
